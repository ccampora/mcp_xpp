# MCP X++ Codebase Server

**Status:** Experimental. This project is in early development. Use only in non-production environments.

This repository provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for basic navigation and file operations on Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (D365 F&O) X++ codebases. The server enables AI models and tools to browse directories, read files, and perform simple text searches within a configured D365 F&O codebase.


## Roadmap

### Current State (Phase 1)
* Basic file system browsing and navigation
* File reading with size limits
* Basic text search across files
* Simple object existence validation

Note: No advanced object discovery, code analysis, or project-specific features are available at this stage. Advanced features are planned for future phases, but not yet implemented.

### Planned Phases

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Discovery (Current - Q1 2025)
* Basic file system browsing and navigation
* File reading with size limits
* Basic text search across files
* Simple object existence validation

## Technical Overview

This MCP server provides:
- Basic file reading, directory browsing, and text search
- Security validation to restrict access within the configured codebase
- File size limits and result pagination for performance
- Recognition of common X++ file types (.xpp, .xml, etc.)

*Note: Advanced code analysis and automation features are not yet implemented.*

## Current Capabilities

- Basic file system navigation (PackagesLocalDirectory)
- File reading for .xpp, .xml, and related files
- Simple text search
- Basic object existence validation (file-based)
- Directory browsing with X++ file type recognition
- Security-validated file operations

*Note: Advanced analysis, relationship parsing, and intelligent code understanding are planned for future phases.*

## Features

**Note:** All features are experimental and under active development. Feedback and bug reports are welcome.

### Core File Operations
- File system browsing: Navigate X++ directories and list contents
- File reading: Read X++ source files (500KB max)
- Content search: Basic text search across .xpp, .xml, and other X++ file types
- File information: Basic metadata (size, modification dates, file type)

### Basic X++ Support
- File type recognition: Identify X++ related file extensions
- Simple object discovery: Basic file-based object finding by name pattern
- Basic validation: Check if object files exist in the file system
- Directory structure: Navigate the AOT-like directory structure

### Performance & Security
- Basic indexing: Simple file-based indexing for faster file discovery
- Security validation: Prevent access outside configured codebase directory
- File size limits: Configurable limits (500KB default)
- Result pagination: Limited result sets for responsiveness

*Note: Advanced code parsing, relationship analysis, and intelligent object understanding is planned for future development phases.*

## Documentation

This section will be updated as documentation becomes available.

## Example Workflow

Example usage:

2. Browse the codebase structure with `browse_directory`
3. Find objects by name and type with `find_xpp_object`

## Troubleshooting

**Note:** If you encounter issues, please report them as GitHub issues. This software is experimental and may have unexpected behavior.

### Common Issues

Common issues:
- "No objects of type X found": Build the object index with `build_object_index()`
- "X++ codebase path not set": Set the codebase path with `set_xpp_codebase_path()`
- "Path is outside the configured codebase directory": Use relative paths from the codebase root
- "File too large": The server limits files to 500KB

The server logs errors to stderr, which can be captured by MCP clients for debugging.
