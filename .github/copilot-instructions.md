Golden Rules:
1. DO NOT use Emojis in the code
2. If you are creating test suites or adhoc test file, use the clients provided in the tests/tools folder
3. You will use the Build and Run Task only, do not attempt to build differentely
4. Avoid hardcoding. If you need to hardcode, you MUST ask first
5. Any adhoc tests, misc files, outputs, and/or anything that should not be versioned, put it in the misc folder. 
6. Internal documentation must be place in docs/internal folder.
